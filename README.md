**A conceptual framework to enhance geospatial data catalogs with "Data Candor" - honesty, transparency, and user-centric evaluation.**

## What is the Capitol Framework?

The **Capitol Framework** is a conceptual framework inspired by "Data Candor," as discussed in the [Capital Collective blog post "[Blog Post Title Here - Link to Blog Post Once Available]"](LINK_TO_BLOG_POST_HERE). It aims to address the **"Evaluability Gap"** in geospatial data catalogs â€“ the challenge users face in truly understanding if a dataset is suitable for their specific needs, even when discoverability is improved.

**Think of the Capitol Framework as a set of principles and categories for honest and user-focused data evaluation.** It's rooted in the idea that building trustworthy data ecosystems requires more than just technical metadata; it demands transparency, candidness about limitations, and a focus on user understanding.

**This repository currently provides the documentation of the Capitol Framework (this README) and the framework categories defined in a CSV file ([`capitol-framework.csv`](LINK_TO_CSV_IN_REPO_HERE)).**  This CSV file outlines the categories and their descriptions, serving as a starting point for implementing the Capitol Framework in various contexts.

## Core Principles: Data Candor

"Data Candor" within the Capitol Framework is built upon these core principles:

* **Honest Context:** Providing transparent details about data collection, processing, and intended purpose, going beyond technical specifications.
* **Candid Applications:**  Showcasing curated examples of effective dataset uses, drawing on community and expert knowledge to offer honest appraisals of suitability.
* **Transparent Caveats:**  Explicitly outlining known limitations, potential biases, and inappropriate use cases to promote responsible data application.
* **Trustworthy Provenance:**  Ensuring transparency in the data review process and sources, enhancing user trust and understanding of data quality.
* **Community Vibes:**  Capturing qualitative and contextual information that provides a broader understanding of the dataset's relevance, impact, and unique characteristics.
