## What is the Candid Core Framework?

The **Candid Core Framework** is a conceptual framework inspired by "Data Candor," as discussed in the [Capital Collective blog post "[Blog Post Title Here - Link to Blog Post Once Available]"](LINK_TO_BLOG_POST_HERE). It aims to address the **"Evaluability Gap"** in geospatial data catalogs â€“ the challenge users face in truly understanding if a dataset is suitable for their specific needs, even when discoverability is improved.

**Think of Candid Core as a set of principles and categories for honest and user-focused data evaluation.** It's rooted in the idea that building trustworthy data ecosystems requires more than just technical metadata; it demands transparency, candidness about limitations, and a focus on user understanding.

**This repository currently provides the documentation of the Candid Core Framework (this README) and the framework categories defined in a CSV file ([`capitol-framework.csv`](LINK_TO_CSV_IN_REPO_HERE)).**  This CSV file outlines the categories and their descriptions, serving as a starting point for implementing the Capitol Framework in various contexts.

## Core Principles: Data Candor

"Data Candor" within the Candid Core Framework is built upon these core principles:

* **Honest Context:** Providing transparent details about data collection, processing, and intended purpose, going beyond technical specifications.
* **Candid Applications:**  Showcasing curated examples of effective dataset uses, drawing on community and expert knowledge to offer honest appraisals of suitability.
* **Transparent Caveats:**  Explicitly outlining known limitations, potential biases, and inappropriate use cases to promote responsible data application.
* **Trustworthy Provenance:**  Ensuring transparency in the data review process and sources, enhancing user trust and understanding of data quality.
* **Community Vibes:**  Capturing qualitative and contextual information that provides a broader understanding of the dataset's relevance, impact, and unique characteristics.

## Synopsis of Candid Core Framework Categories

The Candid Core categories are structured to provide a comprehensive yet user-friendly evaluation of geospatial datasets, embodying the principles of Data Candor. They can be broadly grouped into areas focusing on:

* **Understanding Dataset Context and Provenance:** Categories like `review_method`, `changelog`, `breaking_changes`, `support_status`, `vibes`, `target_audience`, `derived_datasets`, `linked_datasets`, and `competitor_datasets` aim to offer a transparent understanding of the dataset's origins, evolution, community perception, and intended audience. This helps users contextualize the data and assess its relevance and trustworthiness.

* **Guiding Effective and Responsible Application:** Categories such as `suggested_uses`, `application_limitations`, `technical_expertise_level`, `accessibility_providers`, `carbon_energy_cost`, `teaching_resources`, `community_resources`, `example_apps`, `example_art`, `example_games_interactive_art`, `api_function_examples`, and `key_instructions` are designed to empower users to apply the data effectively and responsibly. They provide candid examples of uses, highlight limitations and potential biases, offer guidance on technical requirements, and point to helpful resources and examples for practical application.

Together, these categories move beyond basic technical metadata, encouraging a holistic and honest evaluation of geospatial datasets. They aim to bridge the "Evaluability Gap" by providing users with the critical information needed to confidently assess data fitness for purpose and utilize it effectively and ethically.
